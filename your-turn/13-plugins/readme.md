# Your turn: Plugins

## Objectives

* Explore existing plugins

## Explore existing plugins

First, look around the existing plugins that make up PyCharm. Open preferences / settings and find the plugins section.

Click through them and see their descriptions on the right.

## Discover new plugins

In that same dialog, press `Browse repositories`. Use the search field to explore things you don't already have.

## Try 5 new ones

Choose 5 plugins from the browse area and install them and see what they have to offer. Have fun. You can always disable or uninstall them later.
